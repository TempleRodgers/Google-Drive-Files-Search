# Google-Drive-Files-Search
Using Apps Script and Google Sheets to search Google Shared Drives and store the results in a spreadsheet
If you work in a large organisation that uses Google Workspace, you may have access to many shared drives.
Sometimes you may have to search for a needle in a haystack of shared drives ... you can get results 
using the drive search, but the results can be fluid and it's easy to forget what you searched for and 
what you viewed last.
By storing the search results in a tab of a spreadsheet and the search string in the tab name, you can 
store and filter through the results of a search.
There's two versions of this:
  1. Search every shared drive I have access to
  2. Search a list of shared drives
